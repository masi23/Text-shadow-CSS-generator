# Text-shadow-CSS-generator
Project nearly identical to previous one called "box-shadow css generator". It allows you to easily style and visualize text shadow that you need.

Crucial difference between this and mentioned projects is that I used Sass preprocessor in process of creation. 

As always, if you find this project helpful, feel free to use it as you wish.
